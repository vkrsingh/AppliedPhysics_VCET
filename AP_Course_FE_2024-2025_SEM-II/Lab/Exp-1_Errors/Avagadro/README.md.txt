# Physics Lab Simulation Experiment

## Dear Students,

From tomorrow, we will be performing a **simulation experiment** during the physics lab session. To ensure a smooth and productive session, please take note of the following instructions:

### Important Requirements:
- Bring your own **laptop** OR ensure that **at least one laptop is available per group**.
- **Download and install Avogadro software** in advance using the following link: [Avogadro Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/avogadro/)

Downloading the software beforehand will help us **start the experiment promptly** without unnecessary delays due to troubleshooting.

Looking forward to a productive and engaging session!
