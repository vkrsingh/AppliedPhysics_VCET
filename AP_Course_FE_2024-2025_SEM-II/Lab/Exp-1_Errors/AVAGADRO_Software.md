Dear Students,
From tomorrow, we will be performing a simulation experiment during the physics lab session.
I kindly request to bring your own laptop OR at least one laptop should be there in each group.
Please download the Avogadro software in advance using the following  
link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/avogadro/
This will help us start the experiment promptly without any delays due to troubleshooting.
Looking forward to a productive session!
