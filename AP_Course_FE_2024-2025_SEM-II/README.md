### Assessment:
**Internal Assessment Test (IAT) for 15 marks each:**
• IA will consist of Two Compulsory Internal Assessment Tests. Approximately 40% to
50% of the syllabus content must be covered in the IAT-I and the remaining 40% to
50% of the syllabus content must be covered in the IAT-II.

**Term Work Marks:** 25 Marks (Total marks) = 10 Marks (Experiment) + 10 Marks Project + 5
Marks (Attendance)

**Project work:** Execution of project as per the plan submitted in semester-I , A working model or a
simulation model or a study report leading to a conclusion as anticipated in semester –I is required to
be used for awarding marks. A proper rubric should be framed.

## End Semester Theory Examination:

### Question Paper Format:

- The question paper will comprise a total of **five questions**, each carrying **15 marks**.
- **Q.1** will be compulsory and should cover the maximum content of the syllabus.
- Remaining questions will be mixed in nature:
  - Part (a) and part (b) of each question must be from different modules.
  - For example, if Q.2 has part (a) from Module 3, then part (b) must be randomly selected from another module.
- A total of **three questions** need to be answered.
